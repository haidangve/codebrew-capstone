# Self-Service Tanning Bed Management System

## üìñ Overview
This project is a **self-service Android application** built as a capstone for the Business Information Systems program at Saskatchewan Polytechnic. The solution was developed for *Prairie Micro Works Incorporated* to replace a failing swipe card system with a modern, tablet-based platform.
